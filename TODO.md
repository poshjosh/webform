```

Given a form with say Product form will all the above fields. 
When a product_category is selected, product_subcategory field is populated with values.
When a product_subcategory is selected, brand field is populated with values.
When a brand is selected, model field is populated with values.

When the earlier selected product_category is changed, the selections for 
product_subcategory, brand and model still remain even though now out of context.

When product_subcategory is populated for product_category -> `category.subcategory`
When brand is populated for product_subcategory -> `category.subcategory.brand`
